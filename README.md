# 🔒 Lockout Sharing Service by **Fnx**  
> Seamless World of Warcraft raid lockout access – fast, free, and automated.

### 🧠 What’s Lockout Sharing?

Lockout sharing lets you skip straight to a specific boss in a raid instance by using someone else’s saved lockout.  
This means you can farm that one boss for loot or mounts without clearing the whole raid!

#### 🔧 Example Use-Case:
Let’s say the 9th boss drops the mount you want.  
Fnx provides you a lockout where bosses 1–8 are already down—you zone in, kill the 9th, and you’re done.  
No need for Fnx to join your group. It’s all automated.

   - `!sharing` – to receive a lockout link.

### 🔍 How to use ICC lockout

> “**KEEP IN MIND THIS IS HORDE ONLY AND WILL NOT WORK AS ALLIANCE**”

- Step 1: Set Raid Difficulty to Heroic and 25 Player, Enter ICC, Kill the first boss (Lord Marrowgar), Exit ICC
- Step 2: Outside ICC,
- `/w Sìxmonths-Ravencrest !sharing`
- Accept the invite
- Step 3: Enter ICC, Accept the lockout, Use Teleporter to Upper Spire, Kill Blood-Queen Lana'thel, Use Teleport to Light's Hammer, Exit ICC (this is important, if you go straight to Lich King here, it'll still be on Normal)
- Step 4: Enter ICC, Use Teleporter to Upper Spire, Go to the centre of The Spire to teleport to Lich King, Kill Lich King
- Step 5: (optional) Loot Invincible's Reins
