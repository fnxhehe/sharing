# 🔒 Lockout Sharing Service by **Fnx**  
> Seamless World of Warcraft raid lockout access – fast, free, and automated.

### 🧠 What’s Lockout Sharing?

Lockout sharing lets you skip straight to a specific boss in a raid instance by using someone else’s saved lockout.  
This means you can farm that one boss for loot or mounts without clearing the whole raid!

#### 🔧 Example Use-Case:
Let’s say the 9th boss drops the mount you want.  
Fnx provides you a lockout where bosses 1–8 are already down—you zone in, kill the 9th, and you’re done.  
No need for Fnx to join your group. It’s all automated.

   - `!sharing` – to receive a lockout link.

Here’s why that might happen:
